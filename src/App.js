        Hi, I’m Stanley! <br />
        I’m a Business and Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, passionate about the intersection of technology and finance.
        Over the past summers, I’ve gained experience at JP Morgan working in Wealth Management and Investment Banking 
        Credit Risk in their internship program. <br />
        Outside of work, I love surfing, playing basketball, football, and poker. I’m a die-hard fan of the Golden State Warriors, 
        San Francisco 49ers, and Real Madrid. I also enjoy playing competitive fps games such as Counter Strike <br />
        I’m always eager to learn and explore how technology can shape the future of finance. Feel free to connect with me!
